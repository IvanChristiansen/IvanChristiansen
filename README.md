- 👋 Hi, I’m @IvanChristiansen.  I am an experienced full-stack web developer with over 12 years of development experience in DotNet.
- 👀 I’m interested in meeting with and getting to know other DotNet Developers. 
- 🌱 I'm a little old school and updating my skills.  I am currently learning Angular.  I've worked with a custom single page web app like Angular in the past.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on scalable applications.
- 📫 You can reach me at ivanc@comcast.net.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Several years ago I did front-end web development on Intel's home page.  This was back when Netscape was popular.
